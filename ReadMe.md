## 🎤 Voice Commands Feature (Speech Recognition)

Linguin responds to your spoken prompts using Android’s Speech Recognition + Text-to-Speech (TTS). You can **talk to your pet**, and Linguin will speak back in a fun, Linux-themed tone.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Kotlin** – Modern Android development
- **SpeechRecognizer** – For live voice command input
- **TextToSpeech (TTS)** – To speak Linguin’s responses
- **Room Database** – To store pet stats (hunger, happiness, sadness)
- **WorkManager** – To simulate realistic idle behavior over time
- **Rive Animations** – Lottie-like animations for cute pet reactions
- **Safe Args Navigation** – For passing item data like food or toys
- **MVVM Architecture** – Clean separation of UI and logic

## 🧪 Triggering Speech Commands in Code

Speech recognition checks phrases like this:

```kotlin
when {
    spoken?.contains("hungry") == true -> speak("I'm running on fumes. Feed me some Top Ramen.")
    spoken?.contains("status") == true -> {
        val pet = viewModel.pet.value
        speak("Current hunger: ${pet?.hunger}, happiness: ${pet?.happiness}, sadness: ${pet?.sad}")
    }
    spoken?.contains("what is linux") == true -> speak("Linux is a kernel, but it’s also a way of life.")
    // ...more commands
    else -> speak("I only speak fluent Penguin. Try again?")
}

## 🐧 Offline AI Responses – Powered by JSON Logic

Linguin may look like your average cute penguin, but behind the scenes, he’s got some clever offline AI magic going on — no OpenAI API needed for his witty responses!

### 🧠 How It Works

We use a local `triggers.json` file (preloaded) that contains a list of fun, Linux-themed **trigger phrases** and corresponding **replies**.

When a user types or speaks to Linguin, the app checks if their input **matches any trigger** (case-insensitive and partial matches allowed). If it does, Linguin replies with the associated response — through text, speech, and animation.

### 📁 Sample JSON Structure

```json
[
  {
    "trigger": "linux",
    "reply": "Linux is love. Linux is life. 🐧💚"
  },
  {
    "trigger": "arch",
    "reply": "Arch is beautiful... and deadly. But I use it BTW. 🧠🐧"
  },
  {
    "trigger": "do you sleep?",
    "reply": "Only when the device is idle. Otherwise, I’m multitasking like a Linux kernel. 🧠⚙️"
  }
]
