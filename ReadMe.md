## ✨ Features

- 🐧 **AI-Driven Reactions**  
  Linguin reacts uniquely to food, toys, and speech prompts using pre-defined reactions or OpenAI-powered responses.

- 🎙️ **Text-to-Speech & Voice Recognition**  
  Talk to Linguin, and he'll respond with witty Linux-based remarks in a human male voice.

- 📉 **Pet Stat Simulation**  
  Track Linguin’s happiness, hunger, and sadness levels in real-time. Neglect him, and he’ll let you know!

- ⏰ **Background Simulation (WorkManager)**  
  Even when you’re away, Linguin’s behavior evolves over time—just like a real digital pet.

- 🎞️ **Dynamic Animations (Rive + Lottie)**  
  Stunning animations bring Linguin to life, reacting to actions like feeding or chatting.

- 🛍️ **Item Shop Integration**  
  Give Linguin toys and food (like Top Ramen or the dreaded Windows Toy) — he’ll love or hate them accordingly!

- 🔐 **Offline Mode with Local Database (Room)**  
  All pet states are stored offline, keeping your data safe and accessible without internet.
